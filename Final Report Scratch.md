### *Biggest Assumption of Collaborative Filtering*:
  
	Users who have similar preferences in the past will have similar preferences in the future.

* *Similar*: For example, if user 1 likes item 1 and gives item 1 a 5 star, then this user would probably like a similar product item 2, should this item be recommended to the user. 

### *Advantages of Collaborative Filtering*:
1. The recommendation can be done by utilizing only users' ratings of movies. Sometimes it may be hard to find out the reason why a user likes certain items. With collaborative filtering, however, a heuristic result can be obtained quickly, and the quality of this result improves drastically as the amount of data increases.
